# How to Create a Map.

If you want to make a map you have to create a text file with the suffix `.map`.

For Example:

```
01-test.map
```
| Letter | Description |
|---|---|
| # | This is a wal. It serves the purpose of blocking the players movement. |
| @ | This is the Player. Nothing to be said here :) |
| $ | This is a box. The player can push this box around. It also block the player if it is being pushed against a wall. |
| . | This is a goal. The Player has to move the box over the goal to compleet the game. |

# Rules:
1. The Player can't finish the game if there are more Boxes than goals and vice versa. (No measures to enforce this rule.)
2. There can only be one Player. (No measures to enforce this rule.)
